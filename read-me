This is a project dedicated for machine learning with applications in finance. 

The files in this folder are used for scrapping data from the following sites: 

http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/international-markets/indices/home/sp-500.html

http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/international-markets/indices/home.html

And the downloaded CSV file (companylist.csv). 

In total, there are 3,350 tickers being used. These tickers exclusively come form NASDAQ and NYSE, seeing that these are the two available sources of information. 

For each ticker, it is grabbing fundamental data using the following site: http://uk.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&btn=istart_date&mode=quarterly_reports&symbol=____%3A____&istart_date=____.

To run the code, please use get_london_exchange_data.m
To do so, type get_london_exchange_data into matlab. 

Currently the system is set to pull 5 pages of data per ticker. This can be changed to any preferred number. 

Edits were made to hist_stock_data.m to ensure that only data from Friday closing period is kept. ensure_nine_years is written to ensure that we only keep stocks with at least 9 nines of quarterly reports since the current year. 

Code is borrowed from the web (getTableFromWeb and csvimport).

Further improvements are to be made by pulling more data from other international markets, to improve robustness and quality of the data kept it, and to save the data in an orderly fashion (db/json/pickle). 

Please feel free to email mike.wu@new.ox.ac.uk for further questions about usage.
