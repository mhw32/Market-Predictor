After reading the CUSUM paper, I am also considering a setup revolving around that and ARL. This would be very educational to me to get me familiar with a new system instead of looking at the same one I usually use (SVM). 

Of course, this isn’t really going to be having anything to do with value investing because by the nature of detecting “abrupt changes”, CUSUM focuses more on instantaneous shifts in data. 

For this, the kind of feature selection techniques doesn’t really change from before — still a focus on Stepwise Regression and PCA. 

For labelling, I think now it might be useful to have multiple labels! 
I propose the following four classes:

1) Really good stock (high likelihood of increasing in price — probably should buy)
2) Border good stock (middle likelihood of increasing in price - do some action) 
3) Border bad stock (middle likelihood of decreasing in price - do some action)
4) Really bad stock (high likelihood of decreasing in price — probably should sell)

I think this would be a good set of labels because then I can know when to sell and buy based on the my labelling algorithm. These labels are just my own prejudice on how to work with “hot stocks” — buy when it starts jumping up high, sell when it starts falling. 
(Funny thing is this is exactly what value investing tells me will lose me money — guess I can’t really believe them until I find out for myself right?)

For the labelling algorithm, I’m going to use CUSUM with probably ARL. There will most likely be a second layer of learning to choose the ARL — as in a feedback loop: try increasing (or decreasing) ARL until total marginal profit is falling, and then go back down — that way oscillate between them until I find a really good one. I have a feeling a short ARL won’t be very accurate but necessary for such quick decisions for stock selling. 

What I think I’m going to do is a CUSUM for each of my features, and see if any of them create abrupt changes that follow abrupt changes in return/price. More interesting if any of them consecutively spike BEFORE spikes in return/price (may be a direct/inverse relationship). To do that… maybe I’ll use just linear regression — something simple.
